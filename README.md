# Handwritten Number Recognition with Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

This project demonstrates how to build and use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize handwritten digits from images. The model is trained on the MNIST dataset and can predict digits accurately from uploaded images.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a system that can:
- Accept an image containing a handwritten digit as input.
- Process the image to extract features using a CNN.
- Predict the digit depicted in the image with high accuracy.

## Features

- **Upload Image**: Users can upload an image containing a single handwritten digit.
- **Image Preprocessing**: Uploaded images are processed to enhance recognition accuracy.
- **CNN Model**: A trained CNN model is used to predict the digit based on the preprocessed image.
- **Visualization**: The predicted digit and the processed image are displayed for user verification.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
